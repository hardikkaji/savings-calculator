  "faq.q1.question": "How are savings calculated?",
  "faq.q1.answer": "We use monthly compound interest. Formula: (1) Add monthly contribution to balance, (2) Apply monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12). Example: Start with $10,000, invest $500/month at 8% annually for 1 year. Month 1: ($10,000 + $500) × (1 + 0.08/12) = $10,570. Month 2: ($10,570 + $500) × (1 + 0.08/12) = $11,143.80. After 12 months: $16,596. Total invested: $16,000 ($10,000 + 12×$500). Wealth gained: $596.",
  "faq.q2.question": "What does Expected Return mean?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "Expected Return is the annual percentage growth you anticipate. We convert it to a monthly rate by dividing by 12 and apply it each month.",
  "faq.q3.question": "Is the calculation adjusted for inflation?",
  "faq.q3.answer": "No. The calculator shows nominal growth. To account for inflation, you can reduce the expected return by your estimated inflation rate.",
  "faq.q4.question": "Can I model irregular contributions?",
  "faq.q4.answer": "Not yet. The current version assumes a fixed monthly contribution. We plan to add variable contributions in a future update.",
  "faq.q5.question": "Why do the monthly totals look slightly different from the final total?",
  "faq.q5.answer": "Monthly rows are rounded for display. The final total uses the full compound formula, so small rounding differences can appear.",
  "faq.q6.question": "How is the withdrawal calculator calculated?",
  "faq.q6.answer": "Using Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) methodology: (1) Withdraw amount from balance, (2) Apply monthly interest on remaining balance. Example: Start with $100,000, withdraw $2,000/month at 6% annually for 1 year. Month 1: $100,000 - $2,000 = $98,000, then add interest: $98,000 × (1 + 0.06/12) = $98,490. Month 2: $98,490 - $2,000 = $96,490 × 1.005 = $96,972.45. After 12 months: Final value ≈$77,400. Total withdrawn: $24,000. Note: Our calculator shows pure mathematical results without fees, taxes, or expense ratios that real-world investments may have.",
  "faq.q7.question": "What happens if my balance runs out before the end?",
  "faq.q7.answer": "Withdrawals are capped at the remaining balance, so the account will not go negative. Once the balance reaches zero, the final value stays at zero.",
  "faq.q8.question": "How is total withdrawal calculated?",
  "faq.q8.answer": "Total withdrawal is the sum of all monthly withdrawals actually taken over the time period. If the balance is depleted, the remaining months contribute zero.",
